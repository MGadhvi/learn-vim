# how I learned Vim

## introduction

In this document, I'll share with you how I learned Vim, listing common commands and tips to help get you started with Vim. You should at least know what Vim is before reading this document. You should also know the basics of using a command prompt. (Also, I use NeoVim, but that shouldn't change any of the instructions/commands below.)

## launch / exit Vim
- type "vim" into your terminal of choice
- to open a file type "vim [path to file]
- to exit Vim, type ":q" and hit enter
- if you made changes to a document and want to save and quit: ":wq"
- if you want to discard changes: ":q!"

## modes

- normal - When you lanuch Vim, you'll be in normal mode, which is when you can use all the fancy key-bindings (keyboard shortcuts) that make Vim so special.
- insert - To actually type text, hit "i" or "a" and then start typing. (Try and figure out the difference between i and a.) Use escape to get back into normal mode.
